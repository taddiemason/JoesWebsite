        <h2>A New Start</h2>
        <p><em>May 22, 2025 by Joe</em></p>
        <p>My name is Joe. At least, that’s the name I was given and the name most people still know me by. But today, I’m taking the first real step toward becoming who I’ve always been. My name is Joanna. And this is the beginning of my story.</p>

        <p>I grew up on Teakwood Terrace, the kind of street where kids rode bikes until the streetlights came on, and everyone knew which house gave out the best Halloween candy. My family still lives there, in the same split-level house with the worn green shutters and the cracked driveway that somehow never gets fixed. It’s where I learned how to keep quiet, how to keep my head down, and how to do what was expected.</p>

        <p>For as long as I can remember, I worked at my family’s limo business, but not in the way that might sound. I wasn’t behind the wheel in a sharp black suit, charming clients on the way to weddings or proms. I was the one in the back lot with a bucket and sponge, scrubbing down the stretch Escalades and polishing chrome in the summer heat. Rain or shine, hot or freezing, I was there. Cleaning. Wiping. Doing the invisible work.</p>

        <p>People never looked twice at me. I was “just Joe”—the quiet guy who kept the cars looking good. And I convinced myself for a long time that maybe that was enough. That maybe a small life was a safe life. That blending in was the best I could hope for.</p>

        <p>But the truth is, I’ve always known something wasn’t right. That the way people saw me didn’t match the way I felt inside. I didn’t have the language for it as a kid. I just knew I felt out of place in my own skin. Like I was living someone else’s story, stuck in a role that had been assigned to me.</p>

        <p>Now I’m 33 years old, and I’ve spent most of my life pretending. Pretending to be a man. Pretending to be okay. Pretending I didn’t want more. And I'm tired of pretending.</p>

        <p>So today, I’m saying it plainly: I am a woman. My name is Joanna. And I am beginning my transition.</p>

        <p>I don’t know what the road ahead looks like. I don’t have all the answers, and I know there will be tough days. But for the first time, I’m giving myself permission to dream of a life that feels honest. I’m not trying to be anyone else anymore. Just me.</p>

        <p>If you’ve ever felt invisible or afraid to take that first step, I hope you know you're not alone. I’ll be using this blog to share my journey, messy, beautiful, uncertain as it may be.</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading. Here’s to second chances.</p>

        <p>—Joanna (formerly Joe)</p>

        <h2>Telling Pam and Steve</h2>
        <p><em>May 24, 2025 by Joanna</em></p>
        <p>Two days ago, I hit “publish” on the first post of my life that felt real.</p>
        <p>Today, I’m sitting here still reeling from what came next: I told my parents.</p>

        <p>My mom, Pam, took a break from folding laundry when I walked in. She always folds laundry in the living room—knees up, talk shows murmuring in the background, a cup of lukewarm tea within reach. I sat down next to her. I didn’t plan some dramatic speech. I just told her.</p>

        <p>"Mom," I said, "I’m transitioning. I’m not going to live as Joe anymore. My name is Joanna."</p>

        <p>She didn’t blink. She didn’t even look surprised.</p>

        <p>She put the towel down, took a breath, and said, "I always knew you were carrying something. I just didn’t know what. Thank you for telling me."</p>

        <p>Then she hugged me—tight, firm, full of more acceptance than I’d ever hoped for.</p>

        <p>She asked questions. She listened. She even cried a little, but not because she was sad. “I’m crying,” she said, “because I’m proud of you. This takes guts.”</p>

        <p>I didn’t realize how much I needed her words until they were there. It felt like the air came back into the room.</p>

        <p>Then came Dad.</p>

        <p>Telling Steve was like stepping onto thin ice, knowing it might crack no matter how gently I walked.</p>

        <p>He’s a former Secret Service agent. The kind of man who irons his jeans, triple-checks door locks, and doesn’t believe in gray areas. He raised me to be “a man’s man.” Strong. Stoic. Unshakeable. I was never any of those things, and I think deep down, he always noticed.</p>

        <p>When I told him, his jaw set. His face went cold, unreadable. The kind of look I imagine he used when he was guarding foreign dignitaries or staring down threats.</p>

        <p>"This some kind of joke?" he said. His voice was low. Dangerous.</p>
        <p>"No," I said. "It’s not."</p>

        <p>He didn’t yell. That might’ve been easier. He just shook his head, like he was trying to shake the words out of his ears.</p>

        <p>"Joe," he said—refusing to say Joanna—"you’re a grown adult. But this... this is not something I can support."</p>
        <p>Then he walked out of the room.</p>

        <p>We haven’t spoken since.</p>

        <p>It hurt more than I expected. I thought I’d prepared for this. For rejection. For disappointment. But nothing really prepares you for your own father looking at you like you're a stranger.</p>

        <p>Still, I don't regret telling him. I won't go back into hiding because someone else can't understand. Especially when I finally understand myself.</p>

        <p>Pam said he'll come around. Maybe he will. Maybe he won’t. But I’m not waiting for permission to be who I am.</p>

        <p>If you’re reading this and dreading that same conversation, please know you’re not alone. Sometimes the ones we love aren’t ready. Sometimes they surprise us in the best ways. Sometimes in the worst. But your truth is still yours.</p>

        <p>I’m still Joanna. Still standing.</p>
        <p>And I’m not going anywhere.</p>

        <p>—Joanna.</p>

  <h2>Letting the Dust Settle</h2>
  <p><em>May 25, 2025 by Joanna</em></p>
  <p>Last night was family dinner. We still do Sunday dinners, like clockwork. Usually it’s a mix of small talk, Pam’s roast chicken, and Steve reminding us the thermostat’s not free. But last night... it was quiet. Unnaturally quiet.</p>
  <p>Steve wouldn’t even look at me.</p>
  <p>He sat at the head of the table, picking at his food like it was a chore. Never said my name. Barely said anything at all. At one point, I dropped my fork and the sound of it hitting the plate felt louder than the entire room. Pam tried to keep the conversation going—asked me about the weather, of all things—but the tension was so thick it felt like breathing through a wool blanket.</p>
  <p>I didn’t cry. I didn’t storm out. I just sat there and let it be what it was. A quiet kind of heartbreak.</p>
  <p>After dinner i went up to my room and called my sister Steph. We haven’t always been the closest,she’s married, just had a kid and a whole life of her own—but I needed someone. I told her. Told her everything.</p>
  <p>She didn’t even hesitate. “Jo,” she said, “I’ve always known. Since we were kids. I support you, always.”</p>
  <p>Hearing that from her... it was like a pressure valve releasing. I didn’t know how much I needed someone in my corner until she put herself there without me asking.</p>
  <p>This morning, I packed a bag and booked a ticket to Columbus. I’m heading to my Uncle Greg’s place for the week. Just need to get out of the house, give Steve some space, and breathe somewhere that doesn’t feel so heavy.</p>
  <p>I used to live with Greg back in my twenties. My parents sent me there to “get my act together” when I was partying too much and coming home at all hours. Columbus always felt like a second chance, even if I didn’t use it right back then.</p>
  <p>Greg’s a hotshot lawyer—big office, big opinions. I don’t know how he’s going to react. I haven’t told him yet. I just said I needed a place to crash for a few days. When I was a kid, he’d take me to Ohio State games—he’s had season tickets forever. Some of my happiest memories are sitting in the stands with him, both of us yelling like fools when the Buckeyes scored. I hope those memories still matter. I hope I still matter to him.</p>
  <p>I’m nervous. But I’m going anyway.</p>
  <p>Sometimes space is the only way people can start to understand. And maybe it’s what I need, too. A week to think. To rest. To remind myself that I’m not broken—I’m just becoming.</p>
  <p>I’ll write again once I get to Columbus.</p>
  <p>Still me. Still Joanna.</p>
  <p>—Joanna</p>

  <h2>Columbus, Again</h2>
  <p><em>May 25, 2025 by Joanna</em></p>

  <p>The drive to Columbus was a mixed bag, some stretches felt like my mind was going a hundred miles an hour, running through everything that’s happened and everything that might come next. Other times, it was quiet. Almost meditative. Just me, the road, and a silence that felt like an exhale I’d been holding in for years.</p>

  <p>When I got to Uncle Greg’s, he was curious, asked what was going on back home that made me need a break. I didn’t have it in me to explain just yet. I think I just wanted to be somewhere that felt simple, even if just for a little while.</p>

  <p>He suggested dinner tonight at Mitchell’s Steakhouse. That place has history for us—he used to take me there when I was living here in my twenties. Back when everything felt a little chaotic, but possibility was always just around the corner.</p>

  <p>I think I might tell him tonight.</p>

  <p>For now, I’m just unpacking, getting settled, and letting myself breathe.</p>

  <p>Still me. Still becoming.</p>

  <p>—Joanna</p>

  <h2>Back Porch Confessions</h2>
  <p><em>May 25, 2025 by Joanna</em></p>

  <p>Tonight was dinner with Greg. We had a few drinks, and I ordered the New York Strip—he had the ribeye, like always. I hadn’t been to Mitchell’s in years and forgot just how good it is.</p>
  <p>We had a couple drinks. Laughed. Talked about work, the Bills’ chances this year, the family, even the weather, anything <em>but</em> the thing I knew I needed to say. And I couldn’t do it. Not in the booth. Not with the waiter refilling our waters and the couple next to us celebrating their anniversary. So I let it go.</p>
  <p>On the way home, I asked him to stop at a gas station. I grabbed a six pack of Voodoo Ranger IPA, my favorite, and we sat out on his back porch, cracking cans and watching the stars get swallowed up by clouds. It felt easy out there. Comfortable. The kind of quiet that invites truth in.</p>
  <p>That’s when I told him.</p>
  <p>I told him I’m transitioning. I told him about the blog, about Pam, about Steve. All of it.</p>
  <p>At first, he didn’t say much. Just kind of sat there with his beer, nodding like he was buffering. But then he said, “I get it. I mean I don’t totally get it, but I understand why you’d need to be honest about it. That matters.”</p>
  <p>He said he’d talk to Steve. Said maybe hearing it from someone else will help him see it differently. Greg’s not Steve’s brother by blood—he’s Pam’s youngest brother—but he was around a lot when my parents were dating. Enough to feel like family in a way that counts.</p>
  <p>Now I’m lying in bed, head spinning. Not just about Steve. About Greg. About what I said. About whether I broke something by being honest. I keep replaying it all, wondering if the silence that followed meant anything more than shock.</p>
  <p>I hope I didn’t lose him.</p>
  <p>But I’d rather risk that than keep hiding.</p>
  <p>I need to sleep. I need my brain to stop rewinding the night like it’s trying to find a version where I stayed quiet. But that version doesn’t serve me anymore.</p>
  <p>Still me. Still becoming.</p>
  <p>—Joanna</p>

  <h2>Morning Light</h2>
  <p><em>May 26, 2025 by Joanna</em></p>
  <p>I woke up to the smell of eggs and toast—something so ordinary, but it felt like the world had shifted. Lighter. Freer. Like I could breathe more fully than I have in a long time.</p>
  <p>Over breakfast, Greg sat across from me, coffee in hand, and told me he spoke to Steve last night. I guess after I went to bed, they had a long talk. About me. About everything.</p>
  <p>Greg said Steve wants to talk. Face to face.</p>
  <p>That sentence landed like a weight and a lifeline at the same time. The thought of seeing Steve again—of standing in front of him, fully myself—is overwhelming. My stomach is in knots. My mind keeps leaping ahead to every possible version of how it could go. But deep down, I know I need to face it. Not for him—for me.</p>
  <p>So, I’m going to pack up my things. Load the car. Head home.</p>
  <p>I don’t know what’s waiting for me, and I won’t pretend I’m not scared. But I’m not hiding anymore. Not from Steve. Not from anyone.</p>
  <p>I’ll keep you all updated. Thank you for walking this with me.</p>
  <p>Still me. Still becoming.</p>

  <h2>The Next Ask</h2>
  <p><em>May 26, 2025 by Joanna</em></p>
  <p>When I pulled into the driveway, Steve was already there, arms crossed, pacing like he’d been waiting a while. My stomach flipped the moment I saw him. But I got out of the car anyway.</p>
  <p>We didn’t go inside. We just stood out there in the cool evening air, the silence between us heavier than anything we said. Finally, he broke it.</p>
  <p>He told me he doesn’t fully understand what I’m going through—but that I’m his child, and I always will be.</p>
  <p>That word—<em>child</em>—stuck with me. It wasn’t daughter. It wasn’t Joanna. But it also wasn’t rejection. It was something. A beginning. And maybe that’s all I can ask for today.</p>
  <p>The next person in the family I need to tell is Uncle Kevin.</p>
  <p>He and I have always been close. Outside of helping with the family business, he acts, mostly small productions, but he’s a big deal in our world. He runs this immersive comedy play called <em>Tony and Tina’s Wedding</em>. I’ve done side parts in it for years. Sometimes the drunk priest. Once even the DJ.</p>
  <p>But the part I’ve always wanted? Tina. The bride. The dress, the hair, the full transformation. I’ve never said it out loud, not even to myself in the mirror. It always felt too far away. Too bold. Too real.</p>
  <p>But now... I think I’m ready to ask. Maybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow. But soon.</p>
  <p>Because the truth is, I’ve never just wanted to act like her, I’ve always wanted to be her. And I don’t think I’m afraid of wanting that anymore.</p>
  <p>Still me. Still becoming.</p>
  <p>—Joanna</p>
